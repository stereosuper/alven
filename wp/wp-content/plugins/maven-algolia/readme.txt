Fully customise WordPress search implementing algolia API

== Description ==
Maven Algolia makes it simple to add Algolia-powered search and autocomplete to your WordPress site.

Posts, Pages, Categories and Post Tags are automatically indexed and sync'd with Algolia via their API.  
Changes and additions to your content (e.g. new or modified posts) are updated in real time, so your site search is always up-to-date. 
Results are displayed in the standard WordPress search results template, so you have total control over the design. We also automatically add a suggestive search out of the box!
